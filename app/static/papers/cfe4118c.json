The Bourbon dynasty, deposed during the French Revolution, was restored to power.\n2. France lost the territories it had annexed under Napoleon.\n3. A series of states were set up on the boundaries of France to prevent future French expansion (e.g., Kingdom of the Netherlands including Belgium was set up in the north).\n4. Prussia was given new territories on its western frontiers.\n5. The German Confederation of 39 states, set up by Napoleon, was left untouched.",

Technology: Rapid improvement in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) like the internet, telecommunications, and cheaper computing costs allows for faster communication across the globe, facilitating distant production and management of operations. \n2.

Transportation Technology: Significant improvements in transportation (e.g., faster container shipping, air freight) have reduced shipping costs and time, making it economically viable to transport goods over long distances.",

      "answer": "Horizontal Distribution of Power: This refers to the sharing of power among different organs of government at the same level—the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Check and Balance System: It ensures that no single organ can exercise unlimited power. Each organ checks the others, maintaining a balance.\n2. Protection of Citizen Rights: The Judiciary acts as an umpire, ensuring that laws passed by the Legislature or decisions taken by the Executive do not violate the Constitution or the rights of citizens.\n3. Accountability: The Executive is accountable to the Legislature (Parliamentary system).\n\nIllustration (India): The Parliament (Legislature) makes laws. The Council of Ministers (Executive) implements them. The Supreme Court (Judiciary) interprets the Constitution and can declare a law invalid if it violates the basic structure of the Constitution.",

      "answer": "Intensive Subsistence Farming:\n1. Area: Practised in areas of high population pressure on land.\n2. Labour: High doses of manual labour are used due to small plot sizes.\n3. Inputs: Low use of modern inputs (HYV seeds, fertilizers) traditionally, though changing now.\n4. Focus: Aim is to produce enough for the farmer's family consumption.\n\nCommercial Farming:\n1. Area: Practised using large land holdings, highly mechanized.\n2. Inputs: High doses of modern inputs (HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides) are used.\n3. Focus: The main objective is high yield and sale in the market.\n4. Regional Variation: The degree of commercialization varies from region to region (e.g., Rice is commercial in Punjab but subsistence in Odisha).",

      "marks": 5,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "The Great Depression hit India hard, primarily due to its integration with the global economy through colonial rule.\n1. Trade Collapse: India’s exports and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. Prices of agricultural produce fell sharply (e.g., wheat prices fell by 50%).\n2. Peasant Distress: Since the colonial government maintained high revenue demands, peasants could not pay rent or debt, leading to massive distress, indebtedness, and hoarding of silver/gold to meet obligations.\n3. Urban Relief: The depression did not affect the urban middle class as severely. Price fall meant that those with fixed incomes (e.g., salaried employees) found themselves better off.\n4. Political Ramifications: The distress caused by the depression led to widespread rural unrest and helped the Civil Disobedience Movement gain greater support among the peasantry, challenging British rule economically.",
      "explanation": "This requires linking the global economic crisis ('The Making of a Global World') to the specific socio-political consequences within India, demanding complex analysis.",
