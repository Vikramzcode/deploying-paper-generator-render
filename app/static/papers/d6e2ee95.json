In Sri Lanka, this was institutionalized by the Sinhala majority through acts (e.g., Sinhala as the sole official language, preference for Sinhala applicants in government jobs). This led to conflict because it marginalized the Tamil minority, eroding their confidence in the government and ultimately causing the formation of separate political organizations demanding a separate Tamil state (Political Science: Power Sharing/Democracy and Diversity).",

      "marks": 5,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "The Great Depression severely affected the Indian economy, particularly agriculture, which was heavily linked to colonial trade: 1. Decline in Exports: Indian exports and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934 as international prices crashed. 2. Price Fall: Agricultural prices in India fell drastically, more sharply than industrial prices. 3. Increased Debt: Farmers found it impossible to sell their harvests and were forced deeper into debt. 4. Land Concentration: Farmers often had to sell their land, precious jewellery, and assets to meet government demands for revenue. 5. Government Refusal: The colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands, further impoverishing farmers and peasants. 6. Urban Gain: Only urban dwellers, who benefited from falling prices of essential goods, fared slightly better (History: The Making of a Global World). (Need five distinct points for full marks.)",

      "marks": 5,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "answer": "Decentralization refers to the process of taking power away from the Central and State governments and giving it to local governments. The 1992 amendment fundamentally changed this system: 1. Mandatory Elections: It became constitutionally mandatory to hold regular elections to local government bodies (Panchayats and Municipalities). 2. Reservation for SC/ST/OBC: Seats were reserved for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. 3. Reservation for Women: At least one-third of all positions were reserved for women. 4. State Election Commission (SEC): An independent State Election Commission was created to conduct Panchayat and Municipal elections. 5. Shared Revenue: State governments were required to share some powers and revenue with local government bodies (Political Science: Federalism).",

      "options": null,
      "marks": 5,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "answer": "Political parties are crucial because they perform essential functions that govern and structure popular will. Functions include: 1. Contesting Elections: They aggregate diverse opinions and contest elections to form government. 2. Forming Policies and Laws: They put forward programmes and policies, and the ruling party implements them. 3. Forming and Running Government: Parties recruit leaders, train them, and then run the government in the country. 4. Role of Opposition: Parties that lose elections play the role of opposition, scrutinizing the government. 5. Shaping Public Opinion: They raise and highlight issues, mobilizing public support and protest. \nNecessity: Without parties, every candidate would be independent, making policy formation and implementation chaotic, fragmented, and impossible to sustain. Parties are necessary to bring diverse representatives together under a common agenda, making government formation and decision-making effective and stable (Political Science: Political Parties).",

      "answer": "The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic developed by the UNDP to rank countries based on levels of social and economic development.\nIndicators used: 1. Health (measured by life expectancy at birth). 2. Education (measured by average years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children). 3. Standard of Living (measured by Gross National Income per capita).\n\nBetter Measure than Per Capita Income: Per capita income only reflects the average economic output of a country, masking internal disparities and ignoring non-monetary aspects of quality of life. HDI, however, combines economic, health, and educational achievements. A high GNI might be achieved through resource exploitation with poor public health outcomes; HDI ensures that progress in health and education is also accounted for, providing a holistic and balanced view of development and well-being (Economics: Development).",
